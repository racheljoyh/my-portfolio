      "Willow is a real-estate marketplace that is heavily based on Zillow, hence the name. It was created using a React and Rails tech stack. It allows users to browse listings without an account, but if users want to send in applications or create and or manage their own listings, they will need to create an account. The Google Maps API and image carousel was used to enhance the user experience when browsing listings. When creating new listings, users can upload multiple images which are securely stored in the database using Active Storage. Browsing through Zillow is guiltily one of my favorite passtimes so creating a dupe of it was very fun!",

      "Red Star Thai is a React and Rails web application for a Thai restaurant. It allows users to log in or create and account in order to browse the menu, place items in their cart and place orders. Users can also see their current and past orders, as well as edit their account information. Admin functionality was also implemented so that the restaurant can view all orders, update their status and also view and/or delete all current users. This was based off my favorite Thai restaurant and my love for food!",
